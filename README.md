# myMicrohouse+

## Description
myMicrohouse+ is a web application designed to monitor and manage off-grid microhouses. It provides users with real-time and historical data on various aspects of their microhouse, including interior and exterior temperatures, solar power levels, battery status, and other essential information.

## Features
Real-time Monitoring: View live data from sensors placed within the microhouse.
Historical Data: Access historical sensor data to track trends and make informed decisions.
User Authentication: Securely access the app with user accounts and authentication.
Dashboard: An intuitive dashboard for visualizing key metrics and statistics.
Alerts and Notifications: Receive alerts and notifications based on user-defined thresholds.
Responsive Design: Access the app on various devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
